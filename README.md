# Caterpillar
BPMN execution engine on Ethereum

Caterpillar is a Business Process Management System (BPMS) that runs on top of Ethereum and that relies on the translation of process models into smart contracts. More specifically, Caterpillar accepts as input a process model specified in BPMN and generates a set of smart contracts that captures the underlying behavior. The smart contracts, written in Ethereum's Solidity language, can then be compiled and deployed to the public or any other private Ethereum network using standard tools. Moreover, Caterpillar exhibits a REST API that can be used to interact with running instances of the deployed process models.

Caterpillar also provides a set of modelling tools and an execution panel which interact with the underlying execution engine via the aforementioned REST API. The latter can also be used by third party software to interact in a programmatic way via Caterpillar with the instances of business process running on the blockchain.

## Running Caterpillar from a Docker Image

It is also possible to execute Caterpillar from a Docker Image without needing to install all the dependencies required to run the applications locally. For that, it is necessary only to install Docker (https://www.docker.com/) on your computer, then open a terminal and run the comand:

     docker run --rm -it -p 3200:3200 -p 3000:3000 -p 8090:8090 jonaschn/caterpillar:v1

Initially, you will see in the terminal, the creation of two services that are necesary for running the running example provided in https://github.com/orlenyslp/Caterpillar/blob/master/caterpillar-core/demo_running_example.bpmn. When the terminal displays the message "Listening on port 3000", it means that the core is running and then open a web browser to interact with execution panel that will be running in the URL http://localhost:3200/.

The execution panel provides a simple interface to interact with the core. The following options are available:

 + Creating and uploading bpmn models by clicking the button with the corresponding name. From the modeler, when you press save, the request is sent to the core. The information about the creation, compilation, and deploy of the smart contracts will be displayed in the terminal where the Docker container is running. If the model was successfully compiled, then a link to display its information will appear on the dashboard with the format <model_identifier>:<model_name>.
 
 > After upload the running example, it is necessary to go to the documentation section for both service tasks and to replace the strings labeled as $Assess_Loan_Risk_Address and $Appraise Property_Address with the corresponding addresses where the services are running. These addresses were displayed in the terminal when the Docker container starts running.
 
+ Searching and displaying all the process model created in the current running of the container. The search will retrieve every model whose name or identifier contains the input as a substring. Empty searches will generate all the models created until now.
 
 + Displaying the solidity code generated from the process model and create new instances. From the dashboard, click the link to display the information of the desired process model. Here, there are accessible the solidity code and the active instances. There are also provided two buttons that allow the creation and updating of running instances. The button labeled with "Refresh instances" will remove from the list all the addresses to processes instances whose execution was concluded.
 
 + Executing process instances. By clicking on the address of the desired instance, it will be displayed a viewer that allows the visualization of the active tasks (in dark green) that can be executed by clicking on them. The viewer also allows switching to each active instance of the process. Every time a new instance is selected, the button labeled with "Go" must be pressed to display the current status of the instance.
 
All the results of the queries performed by the execution panel to the caterpillar core through the REST API will appear also in the terminal where the docker container is running.  
 

## Running Caterpillar locally

Caterpillarâ€™s code distribution in this repository contains three different folders. 
The folder caterpillar_core includes the implementation of the core components, execution_panel includes the code of a BPMN visualizer that serves to keep track of the execution state of process instances and to lets users check in process data, and services_manager contains the implementation for an external service used for demonstration purposes.

For running Caterpillar locally, download the source code from the repository and follow the next steps to set up the applications and install the required dependencies.

## Installing testrpc

The first requirement is to install testrpc which is a Node.js based Ethereum client for testing and development. It uses ethereumjs to simulate full client behavior and make developing Ethereum applications. All the instructions about the installation can be found here: https://github.com/ethereumjs/testrpc.

> Please, be aware to start the testrpc server before running the applications Caterpillar Core and Services Manager. In that respect, you only need to open a terminal on your computer and run the command:

     testrpc

## How to use Caterpillar Core

Open a terminal in your computer and move into the folder __caterpillar_core__. 

For installing the dependencies, run the comands 

     npm install
     gulp build

For running the application you use one of the following comands
 
     npm start     
     
> If the process model has service tasks and consequently needs to interact with the services manager application, then you must run the services manager application and create the corresponding services before running Caterpillar core.

By default the application will runs on http://localhost:3000.

The application provides a REST API to interact with the core of Caterpillar. The following table summarizes the mapping of resource-related actions:

| Verb | URI                       | Description                                                            |
| -----| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| POST | /models                   | Registers a BPMN model (Triggers also code generation and compilation) |
| GET  | /models                   | Retrieves the list of registered BPMN models                           |
| GET  | /models/:mid              | Retrieves a BPMN model and its compilation artifacts                   |
| POST | /models/:mid              | Creates a new process instance from a given model                      |
| GET  | /processes/               | Retrieves the list of active process instances                         |
| GET  | /processes/:pid           | Retrieves the current state of a process instance                      |
| POST | /workitems/:wimid/:wiid   | Checks-in a work item (i.e. user task)                                 |
| POST | /workitems/:wimid/:evname | Forwards message event, delivered only if the event is enabled         |

From the caterpillar_core folder is possible to run the script

     node demo_running_example_test.js
     
to register, create an instance and get the address of a sample process provided in the file __demo_running_example.bpmn__. For running the sample process it is also required to run first the application __services_manager__ and to register the external services.

## How to use Services Manager

Open a terminal in your computer and move into the folder __services_manager__. 

For installing the dependencies, run the comand 

     npm install
     gulp build

For running the application use the comand 

     npm start

By default the application will runs on http://localhost:3010.

The application provides a REST API to interact with services manager. The following table summarizes the mapping of resource-related actions:

| Verb | URI            | Description                                                            |
| -----| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| POST | /services      | Registers an external service                                          |
| GET  | /services      | Retrieves the list of registered external services                     |
| GET  | /services/:sid | Retrieves smart contract/address of an external service                |

From the __services_manager__ folder is possible to run the script

     node oracle_creation.js

to register the services required by the running example provided in the core.

## How to use Execution Panel

Open a terminal in your computer and move into the folder __execution-panel__. 

For installing the dependencies, run the comand 

     npm install

For running the application use the comand 

     npm start
     
Open a web browser and put the URL http://localhost:4200/.

You must use the button refresh to update the instances running, and then select one of the URLs obtained that will contain the address when it is running the smart contract. Then press the button __Open__. Here, you can see the enabled activities visualized in dark green. For executing any enabled activity, just click on it and fill the parameter info if required. All the execution of the process (including internal operations) can be traced from the terminals of __caterpillar_core__ and __services_manager__.
